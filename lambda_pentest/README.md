# Challenge Lambda done in collaboration (Charles Nabbout, RaphaÃ«l Habsieger)


## First analysis
We begin by launching a nmap scan on the `192.168.56.1-255` range and get the following result for `192.168.56.3` :
```

We first tried to connect on the http server only to see an unconfigured apache screen. Then the `42/tcp open nameserver` caught our attention.

When connecting with `netcat 192.168.56.3 42`, we saw a weird feature giving the last connection time.

First, if we enter nothing, we see a whole file. If we enter only root, we see the last time root connected. We supposed the server was running something like `cat some_file | grep OUR_INPUT`. Naturly, we tried to enter `; id` and discovered that we had root access on the machine.

Then, after a few tries, we found that entering `; sudo su` would let us have a shell with root privilege. After looking at the different existing users, we notice one with actual directories in its home : `lambdahacker`.

First we modified its password with `passwd lambdahacker`, then we added `lambdahacker ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL` to `/etc/sudoers` and finally we connected direcly from the VM and saw that we had root privilege.
